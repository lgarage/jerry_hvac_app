**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Session ID:** claude/implement-parts-list-feature-011CUVr5MKFgfmryDZjQBoPm

## ✅ What Was Accomplished This Session

### 1. Parser Bug Fixes (Commit: b225e34)
- ✅ Fixed "AAA AAA battery" duplicate token bug (case-insensitive de-dupe)
- ✅ Fixed qty=24 from "24x24x2 pleated filters" (dimension guard in both client and server)
- Both bugs tested and working ✓

### 2. Corrections Logging System (Commit: e58e60f)
- ✅ Implemented full corrections tracking system
- ✅ Server endpoints: POST/GET /api/lexicon/corrections, GET /api/lexicon/suggestions
- ✅ Client hooks on quantity changes (input, +/− buttons)
- ✅ Fire-and-forget logging (won't block UI)
- ✅ Auto-creates data/lexicon_corrections.json
- ✅ All endpoints tested and working ✓
- ✅ Documentation: CORRECTIONS_TESTING.md, IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

### 3. Development Tools Setup (Commit: 5bedba5)
- ✅ MCP servers configured (.claude/mcp.json):
  - postgres: Direct database access
  - filesystem: Enhanced file operations
- ✅ Custom skills created (.claude/skills/):
  - db-test: Database health check
  - deploy: Restart server
  - quick-commit: Fast git commits
  - check-corrections: Review logged corrections
- ✅ Documentation: PLUGINS_SKILLS_SETUP.md

### 4. Testing & Documentation (Commits: f0b4b68, 4013944, df67ffd)
- ✅ Created test-db.js for database testing
- ✅ Created DATABASE_SETUP.md (Supabase guide)
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

---

## 🎯 Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ Parser (client-side and server-side)
- ✅ Corrections logging endpoints
- ✅ MCP server configuration files
- ✅ Custom skills definitions
- ✅ All code committed and pushed

### What's NOT Connected Yet
- ❌ **Database** - .env points to localhost:5432 (doesn't exist)
  - User has **Supabase** with **pgvector** ready
  - Migrations exist and are ready to run
  - Just needs connection string in .env

### What Needs To Happen Next
1. **User provides Supabase connection string**
2. **Update .env with real connection**
3. **Run migrations** (001_create_tables.sql, 002_create_hvac_terminology.sql)
4. **Seed data** (setup-database.js, seed-terminology.js)
5. **Test**: `node test-db.js` or use `db-test` skill

---

## 📋 Important Context for Next Session

### Database Architecture
- **PostgreSQL with pgvector** (1536-dimension embeddings)
- **Supabase-hosted** (NOT Neon, NOT local Postgres)
- **Two main tables:**
  - `parts` - HVAC parts with semantic search
  - `hvac_terminology` - Normalization with variations
- **Critical feature:** Exact-match refrigerants (safety - no R-410A/R-22 mixing)

### Voice Parsing Flow
```
Voice → Whisper → Client Lexicon → Semantic DB Lookup →
GPT-4 Parsing → Auto-Matching → Corrections Logging
```

### Four AI Agents
1. **Agent 1:** Terminology quality check (after normalization)
2. **Agent 2:** Technical term detector (filters sentence fragments)
3. **Agent 3:** Part suggestion filter (lenient on brands)
4. **Agent 4:** Voice command detector (add part/term vs repair)

### Recent Bug Fixes
- **"AAA AAA battery"** - Fixed via lowercase normalization before de-dupe
- **qty=24 from "24x24x2"** - Fixed via dimension guard in extractLeadingQuantity()

### Files User Mentioned
- ✅ Migrations in `/migrations/` (pgvector ready)
- ✅ Supabase mentioned (user has this)
- ✅ Lexicon system in `data/lexicon.json`

---

## 🚫 What Went Wrong This Session

### Confusion About Database
- I saw database connection failed
- Suggested Neon.tech (wrong!)
- User correctly pointed out they have Supabase already
- Apologized and did full codebase exploration
- User noted I "went through a major update" and memory needs to catch up

### Root Cause
- Didn't properly explore repo FIRST before suggesting solutions
- Should have checked migrations → saw pgvector → asked about Supabase immediately
- Instead jumped to suggestions without understanding context

---

## ✅ Next Session Action Items

### Immediate (When User Returns)
1. **Ask:** "Do you have your Supabase connection string handy?"
2. **Update .env** with real connection string
3. **Verify migrations ran** or run them:
   ```sql
   -- Via Supabase SQL Editor or command line
   \i migrations/001_create_tables.sql
   \i migrations/002_create_hvac_terminology.sql
   ```
4. **Seed data:**
   ```bash
   node seed-terminology.js  # Seeds ~40 HVAC terms
   node setup-database.js    # Seeds 17 sample parts
   ```
5. **Test connection:**
   ```bash
   node test-db.js
   # OR use skill: "db-test"
   ```

### Then Enable MCP Features
1. **Restart Claude Code** (to load MCP servers)
2. **Test MCP:** "Show me all parts in the database"
3. **Test skills:** `db-test`, `deploy`, `check-corrections`

### Then Continue Development
- User can start building features
- Use corrections logging to learn from usage
- Periodically check `/api/lexicon/suggestions`

## 💡 Tips for Next Claude Session

### DO:
- ✅ Read this handoff FIRST
- ✅ Check if .env has real Supabase connection (grep DATABASE_URL .env)
- ✅ Ask user for connection string if still localhost
- ✅ Run codebase exploration BEFORE making suggestions
- ✅ Use the skills and MCP servers that are now configured

### DON'T:
- ❌ Suggest other databases (user has Supabase)
- ❌ Assume localhost database works (it doesn't)
- ❌ Make assumptions - ask user for clarification
- ❌ Forget about the 4 AI agents in the parsing flow
- ❌ Skip the refrigerant exact-match safety feature

## 🎓 What I Learned

### Architecture Insights
- This is a **production-grade voice-to-structured-data pipeline**
- Uses **semantic embeddings** for normalization (not just regex)
- Has **safety features** (refrigerant exact matching)
- Implements **passive learning** (corrections logging)
- Uses **multi-agent validation** (4 agents at different stages)

### User's Setup
- User knows their stack well
- Already has Supabase configured
- Has migrations ready to run
- Just needs the connection plumbing

### Communication
- User is patient but needs clear, focused help
- Prefers actionable steps over lengthy explanations
- Values understanding the system first, then acting

---

## 📞 Quick Commands for User

When you return, just say:

**To connect database:**
```
"Update .env with: [paste Supabase connection string]"
"Run the migrations"
"Test the database"
```

**To test new features:**
```
"db-test"
"check-corrections"
"deploy"
```

**To continue development:**
```
"Show me all parts in the database"
"Let's add some new parts"
"Review the corrections suggestions"
```

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**What works:** Everything except database connection
**What's needed:** Supabase connection string in .env
**Estimated time to complete:** 5-10 minutes once user provides credentials
**Blocker:** Waiting for user to provide connection string

**Next session starts with:** "Do you have your Supabase connection string?"
