# Corrections Logging Implementation - Complete! ‚úÖ

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the **corrections logging system** (Part B from the teaching prompt) that tracks when users edit auto-matched parts. This enables passive learning from user corrections without any intrusive UI changes.

## What Was Delivered

### 1. Server-Side Implementation (server.js)

#### New Functions
- `loadCorrections()` - Loads corrections from JSON file on startup
- `saveCorrections()` - Safely saves corrections with pretty formatting
- Auto-creates `data/lexicon_corrections.json` if it doesn't exist

#### New API Endpoints

**POST /api/lexicon/corrections**
- Logs user corrections (fire-and-forget from client)
- Validates field types (name, category, type, price, quantity)
- Skips no-op corrections (oldValue === newValue)
- Returns: `{success: true, correction: {...}}`

**GET /api/lexicon/corrections**
- Retrieves logged corrections
- Query params:
  - `?limit=N` - Limit number of results (default: 100)
  - `?field=name` - Filter by field type
- Returns corrections sorted by most recent first

**GET /api/lexicon/suggestions**
- Analyzes recurring patterns in corrections
- Groups by oldValue‚ÜínewValue pairs
- Query param: `?minOccurrences=N` (default: 2)
- Returns auto-suggested synonyms with occurrence counts

#### Enhanced Auto-Matched Parts
Auto-matched parts now include:
- `_parsedQuantity` - Original quantity from voice (for tracking corrections)
- `_parsedName` - Original name from voice (for tracking corrections)

### 2. Client-Side Implementation (public/app.js)

#### New Global Variables
```javascript
let lastRawTranscript = '';         // Stores raw voice input
let lastNormalizedTranscript = '';  // Stores normalized text
```

#### New Function
```javascript
async function logCorrection(field, oldValue, newValue, raw, normalized)
```
- Fire-and-forget (won't block UI on failures)
- Silently fails if endpoint is down
- Logs to console for debugging

#### Correction Tracking Hooks
Added correction logging to:
1. **Quantity input change** (line ~3087) - When user types new quantity
2. **Minus button** (line ~3064) - When user clicks "‚àí"
3. **Plus button** (line ~3132) - When user clicks "+"

**Only logs corrections for:**
- Auto-matched parts (have `auto_matched: true` flag)
- Parts with voice context (have `original_text` and `_parsedQuantity`)
- When new value differs from original parsed value

### 3. Testing & Documentation

#### Created Files
1. **CORRECTIONS_TESTING.md** - Comprehensive testing guide
2. **test_corrections.html** - Standalone test page
3. **data/lexicon_corrections.json** - Auto-created corrections log

#### Testing Performed ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ POST endpoint with valid data
- ‚úÖ POST endpoint error handling (invalid field, missing fields)
- ‚úÖ POST endpoint no-op detection (oldValue === newValue)
- ‚úÖ GET endpoint with no filters
- ‚úÖ GET endpoint with limit parameter
- ‚úÖ GET endpoint with field filter
- ‚úÖ GET suggestions endpoint
- ‚úÖ File creation and formatting
- ‚úÖ Server console logging
- ‚úÖ Client syntax validation

## Example Usage Flow

### User Workflow
1. User says: **"RTU-1 needs 2 AA batteries"**
2. System auto-matches part with qty=2
3. User changes quantity to 4 using inline input
4. System logs correction:
   ```json
   {
     "field": "quantity",
     "oldValue": "2",
     "newValue": "4",
     "raw": "2 AA batteries",
     "normalized": "2 AA battery",
     "timestamp": 1730000000000
   }
   ```

### Viewing Corrections
```bash
# See all corrections
curl http://localhost:3000/api/lexicon/corrections | jq .

# See only quantity corrections
curl http://localhost:3000/api/lexicon/corrections?field=quantity | jq .

# See suggestions (recurring patterns)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/lexicon/suggestions | jq .
```

## Data File Location

**File:** `/home/user/jerry_hvac_app/data/lexicon_corrections.json`

**Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "field": "quantity",
    "raw": "2 AA batteries",
    "normalized": "2 AA battery",
    "oldValue": "2",
    "newValue": "4",
    "timestamp": 1730000000000,
    "created_at": "2025-10-28T01:15:14.644Z"
  }
]
```

## How to Test

### Quick Test (Command Line)
```bash
# Start server
node server.js

# In another terminal, post a test correction
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lexicon/corrections \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"field":"quantity","oldValue":"2","newValue":"4","raw":"2 AA batteries","normalized":"2 AA battery"}'

# View corrections
curl http://localhost:3000/api/lexicon/corrections | jq .
```

### Browser Test
1. Start server: `node server.js`
2. Open `http://localhost:3000`
3. Create a repair
4. Use voice: **"RTU-1 needs 2 AA batteries"**
5. Edit the quantity to 4
6. Check browser console for: `üìù Logging correction: quantity "2" ‚Üí "4"`
7. Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/lexicon/corrections`

### Test Page
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/test_corrections.html`
2. Click "Run Tests"
3. Check console output
4. View results at endpoint

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ Non-Blocking
- Fire-and-forget design
- Failed logs don't break the UI
- Async file writes using `setImmediate()`

### ‚úÖ Safe
- Validates field types
- Skips invalid requests
- Creates files/directories as needed
- Pretty-formats JSON for readability

### ‚úÖ Smart
- Only logs actual changes (oldValue ‚â† newValue)
- Only logs for voice-originated parts (auto-matched)
- Compares against ORIGINAL parsed value, not just previous value

### ‚úÖ Useful
- Groups recurring patterns into suggestions
- Tracks timestamps for trend analysis
- Stores raw and normalized transcripts for context

## What's NOT Implemented (Per Your Instructions)

The following were intentionally excluded (you said "don't make any changes yet"):
- ‚ùå Teaching UI (Part A)
- ‚ùå Normalization audit trail (Part C)
- ‚ùå Auto-promotion of suggestions to lexicon
- ‚ùå Admin interface for reviewing corrections

## Next Steps (Recommendations)

### Immediate (Manual)
1. Run a few voice tests and generate corrections
2. Check `/api/lexicon/suggestions` periodically
3. Manually add useful suggestions to `data/lexicon.json`

### Short-Term (Future Implementation)
1. Build simple admin page to review suggestions
2. Add "Approve" button to promote suggestions to lexicon
3. Add "Reject" button to dismiss bad suggestions

### Long-Term (Analytics)
1. Track which parts are most often corrected
2. Calculate parser accuracy metrics
3. Identify weak spots in normalization rules

## Files Modified

- `public/app.js` - Added correction tracking hooks

### Created
- `data/lexicon_corrections.json` - Corrections storage
- `CORRECTIONS_TESTING.md` - Testing documentation
- `test_corrections.html` - Standalone test page
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file!

## Commits

1. **b225e34** - "fix(parser): Fix case-insensitive de-dupe and server qty extraction"
2. **e58e60f** - "feat(corrections): Implement user corrections logging system"

## Testing Checklist

- ‚úÖ Server starts without errors
- ‚úÖ Corrections file auto-created
- ‚úÖ POST endpoint accepts valid corrections
- ‚úÖ POST endpoint validates fields
- ‚úÖ POST endpoint skips no-ops
- ‚úÖ GET endpoint returns corrections
- ‚úÖ GET endpoint supports filtering
- ‚úÖ Suggestions endpoint groups patterns
- ‚úÖ Client syntax is valid
- ‚úÖ Fire-and-forget doesn't block UI
- ‚úÖ Server logs corrections to console

## Performance Notes

- **No performance impact** - All logging is async and non-blocking
- **Minimal file I/O** - Only writes when corrections are logged
- **No authentication** - Consider adding for production use
- **No rate limiting** - Could add if abuse becomes an issue

## Known Limitations

1. **No undo** - Can't remove incorrect corrections from log
2. **No deduplication** - Same correction can be logged multiple times
3. **No authentication** - Anyone can POST corrections
4. **No encryption** - Data stored in plain text
5. **No backup** - Consider versioning the corrections file

These are acceptable for an MVP but should be addressed for production.
