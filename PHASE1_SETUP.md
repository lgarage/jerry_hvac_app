# Phase 1 MVP Setup Guide

## Overview

You've just completed the foundation for Phase 1 MVP of Jerry HVAC app! This setup includes:

‚úÖ **Database Schema** - Customers, Equipment, and Jobs tables
‚úÖ **Auto Job Numbers** - Automatic JOB-2025-001 format generation
‚úÖ **CSV Import** - Bulk import equipment from spreadsheets
‚úÖ **Admin Dashboard** - View and manage equipment data
‚úÖ **REST API** - Backend endpoints for all operations

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

First, create a `.env` file in the project root with your database credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` and add your Supabase connection string:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Database Configuration (Supabase)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
```

### 2. Run the Database Migration

Apply the Phase 1 MVP database schema:

```bash
node run-migration.js migrations/004_create_mvp_foundation.sql
```

Expected output:
```
‚úì Connected to database successfully
üìÑ Running migration: 004_create_mvp_foundation.sql
‚úì Migration completed successfully

Created tables:
  ‚Ä¢ customers
  ‚Ä¢ equipment
  ‚Ä¢ jobs

Created views:
  ‚Ä¢ equipment_with_customer
  ‚Ä¢ job_summary
  ‚Ä¢ equipment_repair_history
```

### 3. Start the Server

```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Access the Admin Dashboard

Open your browser to:
- **Main App**: http://localhost:3000/
- **Equipment Admin**: http://localhost:3000/equipment-admin.html

## ‚úÖ What Works Now (Phase 1 Progress)

Based on the Jerry HVAC Roadmap skill, here's your progress:

### Phase 1 MVP Foundation

- [x] **Auto job number generation** - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
  - Format: JOB-2025-001, JOB-2025-002, etc.
  - Auto-increments per year
  - Trigger-based, no manual input needed

- [x] **Model/serial number storage** - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
  - Equipment table stores all model/serial data
  - CSV import populates this automatically

- [ ] **OCR nameplate extraction** - ‚ùå NOT INTEGRATED YET
  - OCR exists in your app
  - Needs to be wired into job workflow
  - Should auto-populate equipment fields

- [ ] **Photo documentation** - ‚ùå NOT BUILT YET
  - Jobs table has `photos` and `nameplate_photos` fields (JSONB)
  - Need to add photo capture UI
  - Need to add photo upload endpoint

- [ ] **Parse parts from repairs** - ‚ö†Ô∏è EXISTS BUT SEPARATE
  - Parts parsing works in main app
  - Needs to integrate with jobs table
  - Should populate `parts_used` field

- [ ] **Labor hours tracking** - ‚ö†Ô∏è SCHEMA READY
  - Jobs table has `labor_hours` and `tech_signature` fields
  - Need to add UI for tech to enter hours
  - Need to add signature capture

### What to Build Next

According to the roadmap, your next steps are:

1. **Integrate OCR into job workflow** (Phase 1, item #3)
   - Add nameplate scan button when creating/updating jobs
   - Auto-populate manufacturer, model, serial from scan
   - Store extracted data in equipment table

2. **Add photo capture** (Phase 1, item #4)
   - Camera access for mobile techs
   - Upload photos to storage (S3/B2)
   - Attach to jobs via `photos` JSONB field

3. **Wire up parts parsing to jobs** (Phase 1, item #5)
   - Parse parts from tech notes
   - Store in `parts_used` JSONB field
   - Show in job view

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Failed

```bash
‚úó Database connection failed: connection to server failed
```

**Solution:**
1. Check your `.env` file has `DATABASE_URL` set
2. Verify Supabase connection string is correct
3. Test connection: `node -e "require('./db').testConnection()"`

### Migration Already Applied

```bash
‚äô Some objects already exist (this is usually okay)
```

**Solution:**
- This is normal if running migration twice
- Tables use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Safe to ignore

### CSV Import Errors

If import shows errors, check:
1. CSV has header row
2. `customer_name` and `model` are present (required)
3. No special characters in data (use quotes if needed)
4. Columns match expected names (see import section)

### API Returns 500 Error

Check server logs:
```bash
npm start
```

Look for error messages. Common issues:
- Database connection lost
- Missing required fields
- Invalid data types (e.g., text in numeric field)

## üìä Sample Data for Testing

### Sample CSV for Testing

```csv
customer_name,location,equipment_name,manufacturer,model,serial_number,tonnage,refrigerant,voltage
Planet Fitness,Downtown,RTU-1,York,YCAV0036EC300AAAA,PF-DT-001,3.0,R-410A,208/230V
Planet Fitness,Downtown,RTU-2,Carrier,50TCQ06A3A6A0A0A0,PF-DT-002,5.0,R-410A,460V
Planet Fitness,Mall Location,RTU-1,Trane,4TWR4036A1000AA,PF-ML-001,3.0,R-410A,208/230V
Planet Fitness,Westside,Split-1,York,YCJF36S41S1AAAF,PF-WS-001,3.0,R-410A,208/230V
```

### Sample API Test (Create Job)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/jobs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": 1,
    "equipment_id": 1,
    "job_type": "service",
    "priority": "high",
    "problem_description": "Unit not cooling, compressor not running",
    "scheduled_date": "2025-11-01"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "job": {
    "id": 1,
    "job_number": "JOB-2025-001",
    "customer_id": 1,
    "equipment_id": 1,
    "status": "scheduled",
    "created_at": "2025-10-30T..."
  }
}
```
