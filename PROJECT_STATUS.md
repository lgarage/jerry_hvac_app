**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** Paused - Phase 1 MVP In Progress (33% Complete)
**Next Pickup:** Q1 2026 (estimated)

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Vision:** Voice-first field service documentation for HVAC technicians that learns from corrections and automates paperwork.

**Market Opportunity:**
- HVAC techs spend 30-45 min/day on paperwork
- Voice-to-structured-data saves 20+ min/day per tech
- $50-100/month per tech SaaS model = $600-1200/year
- 10 techs = $6K-12K ARR potential for small companies
- Learning system gets smarter with use (competitive moat)

**Current State:** Core AI parsing works. Job tracking foundation complete. Need to finish Phase 1 MVP (photo capture, OCR, labor hours) before customer trials.

---

## ‚úÖ What's COMPLETE (Working Now)

### Voice-to-Parts Pipeline ‚úÖ
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY

The core value prop works:
1. Tech speaks: "RTU-1 needs 4 pounds of 410A and two 24x24x2 pleated filters"
2. System transcribes (Whisper)
3. Normalizes HVAC terms (embeddings: "4-10" ‚Üí "R-410A")
4. Parses equipment, problems, parts (GPT-4)
5. Auto-matches parts from catalog (semantic search)
6. Shows tech for confirmation
7. Logs corrections for ML learning

**Key Safety:** Never fuzzy-matches refrigerants (R-410A ‚â† R-22)

**Files:**
- `server.js` lines 1-2000: Transcription, normalization, parsing
- `public/app.js`: Voice recording, UI display
- `migrations/001_create_tables.sql`: Parts table with vectors
- `migrations/002_create_hvac_terminology.sql`: Terms database

### Parts & Terminology Databases ‚úÖ
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY

- 40+ HVAC terms with variations (R-410A, RTU, damper actuator, etc.)
- Semantic search with embeddings (1536-dim vectors)
- Parts catalog with auto-matching
- Corrections logging system (teaches the AI)
- Lexicon cache for fast lookups

**Files:**
- `data/lexicon.json`: Fast synonym cache
- `data/lexicon_corrections.json`: ML training data
- `seed-terminology.js`: Initial term seeding

### Conversational Chat (Jerry) ‚úÖ
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY

- Message type detection (conversational vs repair docs)
- Concise answers (2-3 sentences)
- Session-based chat history
- Toggle between chat and repairs view

**Files:**
- `server.js` lines 95-280: Chat session management
- `public/index.html`: Chat UI with bubbles

### Job Tracking Foundation ‚úÖ
**Status:** DATABASE READY, UI INCOMPLETE

Implemented (October 31, 2025):
- Customer/Equipment/Jobs database schema
- Auto job numbers: **0001NRP** format (sequential + location + type)
  - 0001NRP = First job, Neenah, Repair
  - 0002NQR = Quoted Repair
  - 0003NSC = Service Call
  - 0004NPM = Preventive Maintenance
- Atomic counter (never resets, race-condition safe)
- CSV bulk import for equipment data
- Equipment admin dashboard

**Files:**
- `migrations/004_create_mvp_foundation.sql`: Customers, equipment, jobs
- `migrations/005_update_job_number_format.sql`: Sequential job numbers
- `public/equipment-admin.html`: Admin dashboard
- `server.js` lines 3022-3571: Job API endpoints

**What Works:**
- Create customers via API
- Create equipment via CSV import or API
- Create jobs with auto job numbers
- Equipment tracks: model, serial, manufacturer, tonnage, refrigerant

**What's Missing:**
- No photo capture yet
- OCR not wired to job workflow
- No labor hours entry UI
- No tech signature capture
- Parts parsing not connected to jobs table

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What's INCOMPLETE (Phase 1 MVP)

### 1. OCR Nameplate Integration ‚ùå
**Status:** Code exists, not integrated

**Current:** OCR can extract text from uploaded PDFs/images
**Needed:** Wire OCR into job workflow
- Tech takes photo of equipment nameplate
- OCR extracts manufacturer, model, serial number
- Auto-populates equipment record
- Saves to `equipment` table

**Impact:** Saves 2-3 min per service call (no manual data entry)

**Estimated Work:** 4-6 hours
- Add camera button to job creation UI
- Call existing OCR endpoint
- Parse manufacturer/model/serial from OCR result
- Auto-fill equipment form fields

**Files to Modify:**
- `public/index.html`: Add camera button
- `public/app.js`: Add photo capture function
- `server.js`: Wire `/api/parse` OCR to equipment creation

---

### 2. Photo Capture & Storage ‚ùå
**Status:** Schema ready, UI not built

**Current:** Jobs table has `photos` and `nameplate_photos` JSONB fields
**Needed:** Camera access, upload, display
- Mobile camera access (Web API)
- Photo upload to storage (start with local, migrate to S3 later)
- Display photos in job view
- Attach to jobs.photos JSONB array

**Impact:** Critical for field documentation, parts ordering accuracy

**Estimated Work:** 8-10 hours
- Camera access UI (mobile-first)
- File upload endpoint
- Storage solution (uploads/ folder initially)
- Display photos in job cards
- Swipe/gallery view

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- `public/index.html`: Camera capture UI
- `public/app.js`: Photo capture logic
- `server.js`: Photo upload endpoint (use multer)
- Create `uploads/photos/` directory

---

### 3. Labor Hours & Tech Signature ‚ùå
**Status:** Schema ready, UI not built

**Current:** Jobs table has `labor_hours` and `tech_signature` fields
**Needed:** Form to log hours and sign off
- Input field for labor hours (decimal: 2.5 hours)
- Signature capture (canvas or typed name)
- Lock job after signature (prevent edits)
- Display in job summary

**Impact:** Required for billing, payroll, customer invoicing

**Estimated Work:** 4-6 hours
- Labor hours input field
- Signature capture (HTML5 canvas or simple text input)
- Update job status to "completed" on sign-off
- Display signature and hours in job view

**Files to Modify:**
- `public/index.html`: Add labor/signature form
- `public/app.js`: Submit labor hours
- `server.js`: PATCH /api/jobs/:id (already supports these fields)

---

### 4. Wire Parts Parsing to Jobs ‚ùå
**Status:** Parsing works, not saved to jobs

**Current:** Parts parsing extracts parts from voice/text
**Needed:** Save parsed parts to `jobs.parts_used` JSONB field
- When tech submits repair, save parts to job record
- Link repair submission to job creation
- Display parts used in job summary

**Impact:** Enables parts inventory tracking, billing, reporting

**Estimated Work:** 2-4 hours
- Modify `/api/submit-repairs` to create job record
- Save `parts_used` array to jobs.parts_used
- Display parts in job view

**Files to Modify:**
- `server.js`: Update `/api/submit-repairs` endpoint
- `public/app.js`: Link repair submission to job creation
